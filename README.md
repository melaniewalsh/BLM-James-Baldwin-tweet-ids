**Tweet ids for "Black Lives Matter" and "Ferguson" tweets that mentioned James Baldwin (2014-2015)**

This repository contains tweet IDs for tweets that mentioned "James Baldwin" -- upper- or lower-case, with or without a hashtag -- as well as "Black Lives Matter," "Ferguson," or the names of 20 other black individuals killed by the police between June 2014 and May 2015. This data was used in my essay “Tweets of a Native Son: The Quotation and Recirculation of James Baldwin from Black Power to #BlackLivesMatter,” American Quarterly, 70, no. 3 (September 2018) and my website, www.TweetsofaNativeSon.com. These tweets were taken from a larger collection that was first purchased from Twitter by [Deen Freelon, Charlton D. McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark](http://dfreelon.org/2017/01/03/beyond-the-hashtags-twitter-data/) and then shared with the public.

To "hydrate" these tweet IDs, I recommend using one of two [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/) tools: either [the command-line tool twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) or [the desktop application Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator). You can find more set-up information and documentation on those respective GitHub pages.

If you decide to hydrate these tweet IDs and use this data, please take steps to acknowledge users'
creative productions as well as protect users from potentially unwanted publicity or harm.
